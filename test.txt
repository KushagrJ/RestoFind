/*

 * Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on
   the server (i.e. outside a web browser).
 * Express.js is a framework that works on top of Node.js.
   It provides various mechanisms to handle common server-side tasks.
 * EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating language that lets you generate
   HTML with plain JavaScript.
 * Mongoose.js is an Object-Document Mapper library which allows you to interact
   with MongoDB (which is a document database) using JavaScript objects.

 * From within a folder, use npm init to create a package.json file for the
   corresponding Node.js web application.
 * npm init -y will create the package.json file using the default settings.

 * Use sudo npm i express mongoose ejs to install express, mongoose and ejs for
   the corresponding Node.js project.

 * Use node app.js or nodemon app.js to start the express server.
   Using nodemon will automatically restart the server whenever changes are
   saved.

 * Go to http://localhost:<port number> (for eg., localhost:3000) using a web
   browser to see the first page hosted from the corresponding web application.

 * Use sudo brew services start mongodb-community@<version no. (for eg.. 6.0)>
   to start the mongodbservice.
 * To access the MongoDB shell, use mongosh (instead of mongo).
